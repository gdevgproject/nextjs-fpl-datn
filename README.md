## About The Project

MyBeauty is a modern, full-stack e-commerce web application designed for a seamless fragrance shopping experience. Built from the ground up as a final graduation project, it showcases a blend of robust back-end functionality with a sleek, responsive user interface.

The core mission of this project was to explore and implement cutting-edge web technologies to solve real-world e-commerce challenges. This includes creating an intuitive shopping flow, managing complex product data, and integrating intelligent features to enhance user engagement and discovery.

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece, demonstrating proficiency in modern full-stack development practices.

## Key Features

While the platform includes all standard e-commerce functionalities, here are some of the standout features we're proud of:

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Discovery**

- **AI Smart Search:** Goes beyond simple keyword matching. Users can describe a mood, occasion, or scent profile in natural language (e.g., _"a fresh scent for summer evenings"_) and receive intelligent, relevant product recommendations.
- **AI Conversational Chatbot:** An interactive assistant trained on the store's product catalog. It can answer detailed product questions, provide personalized suggestions, and guide users through their fragrance discovery journey, creating a boutique-like consultative experience online.

- **Guest & Authenticated Checkout:** A flexible system that supports both registered users and guest checkouts, complete with order tracking capabilities for both.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**

- **Full Store Management:** A feature-rich dashboard allows administrators to manage products, categories, brands, discounts, and orders.
